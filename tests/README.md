# Tests

This is a (currently very small) set of automated tests of ctwm.  It
currently includes a small example unit test, and a few tests of the full
built binary.  Hopefully it'll be expanded over time.


## Framework

This is currently build on cmake's CTest framework.  I'm currently
uncertain whether this is the best idea; it has a number of limitations
and odd behaviors I've already had to work around.  However, we already
have it around, and it at least gets us started.  This space may be
revisited.
